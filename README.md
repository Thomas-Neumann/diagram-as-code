# diagram-as-code
manage diagrams as code

This repo contains proof-of-concept code to create diagrams from code.

Possible applications for this:
 - stop worrying about pixel-perfect alignment, focus on content
 - use the same layout for multiple environments / projects but with
   different names / values
 - make it possible to create diagrams with sanitized names suitable
   for public sharing
 - parse the output of another tool and generate a diagram
   (e.g. Terraform, Dynatrace, wiz.io)
